Tracking for DC Chargers:
Tracking details shared via email within 2-3 weeks of order placement. Customers informed when DC charger shipment is dispatched.

COD Availability:
Zevpoint offers Cash on Delivery (COD) option across India. COD enables customers to pay at time of delivery rather than advance online payment.

Confirmation Advance Required:
Small confirmation advance payment required to secure COD order. Advance confirms customer's genuine intent to receive order. Advance amount is small portion of total order value.

Order Processing After Advance:
Once confirmation advance received, order is processed normally. Tracking details shared via email. Product shipped to customer address.

Balance Payment on Delivery:

Self-Shipping (If Reverse Pickup Unavailable):
In rare cases where reverse pickup cannot be arranged due to logistical constraints, carrier delays, or service unavailability in customer area, customers may be requested to self-ship product to Zevpoint-specified address. Such self-shipping must be pre-approved by Zevpoint support team.

Shipping Cost Reimbursement:
If customer required to self-ship warranty product with prior approval, shipping costs may be reimbursed or adjusted at Zevpoint's discretion.

PENDING DUES AND WARRANTY HOLD
-------------------------------

Warranty Hold Period:
Zevpoint reserves right to withhold any warranty claims, repairs, or replacements during period of unpaid dues. Warranty services will not be provided until payment cleared.

Warranty Resumption:
Once all dues cleared and payment confirmed, warranty period shall resume as per original terms. Important: No extension granted for hold duration - time during hold still counts toward warranty period. Example: If product has 2 years remaining warranty and held for 3 months due to unpaid dues, after payment cleared there are still only 2 years remaining (not 2 years + 3 months).
