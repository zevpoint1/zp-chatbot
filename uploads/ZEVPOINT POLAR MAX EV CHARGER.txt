MAXIMUM 22KW THREE-PHASE POWER
-------------------------------
The Polar Max's defining feature is its maximum 22 kilowatt power output using three-phase electrical supply:

22kW Three-Phase Operation:
The Polar Max delivers its full 22 kilowatt charging power when connected to robust three-phase electrical supply. This represents the maximum practical power for AC home/business charging, matching the capability of commercial public charging stations. At 22kW on three-phase 400V supply, the Polar Max draws 32 amperes per phase across three phases, utilizing the full capacity of a standard 32A three-phase circuit.

Understanding 22kW Power Level:
22 kilowatts is approximately three times faster than standard 7.5kW single-phase chargers and twice as fast as 11kW three-phase chargers. This power level represents the upper limit of Type 2 AC charging capability before transitioning to DC fast charging. Most premium and luxury electric vehicles with advanced onboard chargers can accept 22kW input, though many mid-range EVs are limited to 7.5kW or 11kW.

Three-Phase Power Requirements:
Three-phase electrical supply is absolutely mandatory for 22kW operation. Three-phase power is commonly available in commercial and industrial buildings, large residential properties and villas, premium apartment complexes, properties in industrial zones, hotels and hospitality facilities, and some newer residential developments. Standard homes typically have only single-phase power and would require electrical service upgrade to three-phase for 22kW charging capability.

Current Draw Per Phase:
At maximum 22kW power, the Polar Max draws 32 amperes per phase. This is the same per-phase current as a 7.5kW single-phase charger, but across three phases simultaneously. The balanced load across three phases is more efficient and generates less heat than equivalent single-phase high-power charging.

Vehicle Compatibility Consideration:
Not all electric vehicles can accept 22kW charging. Many Indian market EVs have onboard chargers limited to 3.6kW, 7.5kW, or 11kW maximum. Installing a 22kW Polar Max will only charge as fast as the vehicle's onboard charger allows. Premium vehicles like certain Tesla models, Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, BMW iX, and some European imports support 22kW charging. Verify your vehicle's maximum AC charging rate before purchasing 22kW charger.

Future-Proofing Benefit:
Even if your current vehicle supports only 11kW, installing the Polar Max 22kW prepares your charging infrastructure for future vehicles with 22kW capability. This avoids need to upgrade charger when you purchase a premium EV in the future.
