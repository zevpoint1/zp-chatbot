EMERGENCY EARTHING BYPASS FEATURE
----------------------------------
The Zevpoint Dash includes a unique emergency earthing bypass feature that provides charging capability in locations with problematic earth connections:

Feature Description:
The Dash charger has an option to temporarily bypass or switch off the earthing protection system. This feature is specifically designed for emergency situations only where proper earthing is unavailable but charging is urgently needed.

When to Use Earthing Bypass:
This feature should only be used in genuine emergency situations such as:
- Remote locations where proper earthing infrastructure is not available
- Temporary charging situations where earth quality cannot be verified
- Emergency scenarios where vehicle charging is critical and no alternative charging location exists

Important Safety Warning:
Zevpoint strongly recommends against using the earthing bypass feature except in true emergency situations. Proper earthing is a fundamental electrical safety requirement that protects users from electric shock hazards. Operating the charger without proper earthing significantly increases risk of electrical accidents.

Normal Operation Requirement:
Under all normal operating conditions, the Dash charger must be used with proper earthing. The earthing bypass feature should be considered an emergency-only option, not a standard operating mode. Users should always prioritize finding a properly earthed power supply over using the bypass feature.

How It Works:
The earthing bypass can be activated through a manual switch or control on the charger unit. When activated, the charger continues to operate but earth protection monitoring is disabled. The display will typically show an indicator that earthing bypass mode is active.

Legal and Safety Disclaimer:
Use of the earthing bypass feature is at the user's own risk. Zevpoint recommends this feature only for emergency situations and assumes no liability for accidents or damage resulting from operation without proper earthing. Local electrical safety regulations may prohibit operation of electrical equipment without earthing.

SAFETY AND PROTECTION FEATURES
-------------------------------
The Zevpoint Dash incorporates multiple layers of comprehensive safety protection:

Overload Protection: Prevents damage from excessive current draw beyond rated capacity. Automatically reduces current or disconnects if overload is detected.

Short Circuit Protection: Instant automatic disconnection in short circuit fault conditions to prevent fire hazards and equipment damage.

Leakage Protection: Advanced residual current detection prevents electric shock hazards by monitoring for current leakage to ground.

Ground Protection: Continuous earth monitoring ensures proper grounding connection is maintained. Alerts user if ground connection is lost (can be bypassed in emergency situations only).

Over-Temperature Protection: Thermal monitoring system prevents damage from excessive heat buildup. Reduces charging current or stops charging if temperature exceeds safe limits.

Overvoltage Protection: Guards against input voltage spikes and surges from electrical grid that could damage charger or vehicle.

Undervoltage Protection: Prevents operation when input voltage drops below safe levels, protecting both charger and vehicle battery.

Water Resistance: IP66 rating provides protection against powerful water jets from any direction. Suitable for outdoor use in rain and wet conditions.

Dust Resistance: IP66 complete dust sealing prevents particle ingress even in very dusty environments. Suitable for construction sites and dusty locations.

Cable Protection: Integrated cable strain relief prevents damage from repeated bending and pulling.

The comprehensive safety features make the Dash suitable for use in various environments and weather conditions while maintaining electrical safety standards.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
To safely install and operate the Zevpoint Dash at its full 7.5 kilowatt capacity, the following requirements must be met:

Power Socket Requirements:
A dedicated 32 ampere electrical socket is required for optimal performance. The Dash package includes a 32A industrial socket that must be installed by a qualified electrician. This socket must have adequate connected load capacity to support continuous 32 ampere draw at 230 volts. The socket circuit should be dedicated exclusively to the EV charger with no other appliances or loads sharing the circuit. Socket installation must follow local electrical codes and safety standards.

Electrical Wiring Requirements:
For standard installations, use a minimum of 6 square millimeter, 3-core copper cable. The three cores are: Line (Live), Neutral, and Earth (Ground). Cable insulation should be rated for at least 90 degrees Celsius operating temperature. For installations in hot climate regions or enclosed spaces with limited ventilation, upgrade to 10 square millimeter copper cable to handle heat dissipation better and ensure long-term reliability. Cable run length should be minimized to reduce voltage drop. For cable runs exceeding 20 meters, consult a qualified electrician for appropriate cable sizing to compensate for voltage drop.

Earthing System Requirements:
Proper earthing (grounding) is mandatory for safe operation of the Dash charger under normal conditions. The power socket must be connected to a reliable earth ground with resistance below 5 ohms. The earthing system must comply with local electrical safety codes and national electrical regulations. Earth electrode should be inspected and tested to ensure adequate grounding. While the Dash has an emergency earthing bypass feature, this should only be used in genuine emergency situations - never as standard operating practice.

Circuit Protection Requirements:
Install a 40 ampere double-pole or two-pole MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) on the dedicated charger circuit. The double-pole MCB provides complete isolation of both line and neutral during faults. Additionally install a Surge Protection Device (SPD) to protect against voltage spikes from electrical grid and lightning-induced surges. The SPD should be rated for Type 2 protection (distribution board protection) with voltage clamping levels appropriate for local grid conditions.

Voltage Stabilizer Considerations:
If your location experiences frequent input power fluctuations, brownouts, voltage sags, or voltage instability, use an appropriate voltage stabilizer. The stabilizer should be rated for at least 8 kVA capacity (preferably 10 kVA) to handle the Dash's power requirements with adequate safety margin. This is particularly important in areas with unreliable grid power, frequent voltage variations, or where voltage often drops below 200V or exceeds 250V.

Installation Location Considerations:
The Dash can be permanently wall-mounted using the included bracket or kept portable for travel use. For wall mounting, choose a location that provides: proximity within 5 meters to vehicle charging port when parked, protection from direct harsh weather when possible (though IP66 rating allows outdoor installation), accessibility for cable management and storage, adequate ventilation around charger unit to prevent heat buildup, and convenient access for current setting adjustment when needed.

CHARGING PERFORMANCE AND SPEED
-------------------------------
The Zevpoint Dash delivers professional-grade charging performance:

Charging Speed: At full 7.5 kilowatt output, the Dash can add approximately 30 to 35 kilometers of driving range per hour of charging for most modern electric vehicles. Actual range added depends on vehicle efficiency, battery state of health, ambient temperature, and driving conditions.

Full Charge Time Examples:
- For a 40 kWh battery EV like Tata Nexon EV: approximately 5 to 6 hours from near-empty to full charge
- For a 50 kWh battery EV like MG ZS EV: approximately 6 to 7 hours from near-empty to full charge
- For a 60 kWh battery EV: approximately 8 to 9 hours from near-empty to full charge
- For smaller 30 kWh battery EVs: approximately 4 to 5 hours from near-empty to full charge

Comparison to Standard Charging: The Dash charges more than twice as fast as standard 3.6 kW portable chargers. A vehicle that would take 12 hours to charge with a 3.6 kW charger can be fully charged in approximately 5 to 6 hours with the Dash.

Comparison to Public Fast Charging: While DC fast chargers can charge much faster (50-150 kW), the Dash provides sufficient speed for overnight home charging or full-day workplace charging. For most daily driving needs of 40-80 kilometers, the Dash can fully replenish the battery overnight.

Current Adjustment Impact: When operating at reduced current settings like 16A instead of 32A, charging speed is proportionally reduced. At 16A, the Dash delivers approximately 3.6 kW, similar to standard portable chargers. At 24A, it delivers approximately 5.5 kW. Users can balance charging speed against electrical capacity by adjusting current.
