The 120kW power level provides meaningful charging speed even for vehicles with very large battery packs (200-400 kWh typical for buses and trucks).

Electric Bus Charging:
Electric buses typically have battery capacities ranging from 200 kWh to 400 kWh or more. At 120kW charging power, the Nova 120 can add approximately 120 kilometers of range per hour to most electric buses. A typical electric bus with 300 kWh battery can charge from 20% to 80% (180 kWh) in approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. This makes the Nova 120 suitable for depot charging, route charging, and opportunity charging applications for electric bus fleets.

Electric Truck Charging:
Commercial electric trucks and delivery vehicles have battery capacities typically ranging from 150 kWh to 300 kWh. The Nova 120 provides sufficient power for practical truck charging during loading/unloading breaks, driver rest periods, or overnight depot charging. Medium-duty delivery trucks can charge from 20% to 80% in approximately 1 to 1.5 hours.

Heavy Vehicle Use Cases:
The Nova 120 is ideal for public transit bus depots requiring fast turnaround, logistics companies with electric delivery truck fleets, municipal vehicle fleets (buses, refuse trucks, service vehicles), commercial transportation operations, airport shuttle and coach services, and hotel/resort shuttle fleets.

Passenger Car Ultra-Fast Charging:
For passenger cars, the Nova 120 provides ultra-fast charging that's approximately twice as fast as the Nova 60. Premium electric vehicles with large batteries and high charging acceptance rates benefit most from 120kW power. Cars that can accept full 120kW charge in approximately half the time of 60kW charging.
