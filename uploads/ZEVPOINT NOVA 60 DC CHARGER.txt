DUAL-GUN SIMULTANEOUS CHARGING CAPABILITY
------------------------------------------
The Nova 60's key differentiator is its dual-gun architecture:

Dual CCS2 Charging Guns:
The Nova 60 features two independent CCS2 charging guns (also called cables, connectors, or ports). Each gun has its own cable, connector, and user interface. Both guns can operate simultaneously to charge two different vehicles at the same time. This dual-gun capability dramatically increases station productivity compared to single-gun chargers.

Simultaneous Charging Operation:
When two vehicles are connected, the Nova 60 intelligently allocates its 60kW total power between both vehicles. The power distribution is dynamic based on what each vehicle can accept at its current battery state. Common scenarios include 30kW to each vehicle (equal split when both can accept full power), 40kW to one vehicle and 20kW to the other (unequal split based on vehicle acceptance), or 60kW to single vehicle when only one is connected (full power to maximize speed).

Throughput Advantage:
Dual-gun capability enables the Nova 60 to serve approximately twice as many vehicles per day compared to single-gun chargers. While one vehicle is finishing its charge (slower speed above 80% state of charge), the second gun can be charging another vehicle at high speed. This dramatically improves station utilization during peak hours and maximizes revenue generation potential.

Sequential Charging Alternative:
If operators prefer, the Nova 60 can be configured for sequential operation where it charges one vehicle to completion before starting the second vehicle. However, simultaneous charging provides better throughput in most scenarios.

Use Case Optimization:
Dual-gun simultaneous charging is ideal for high-traffic locations including highway rest stops serving continuous traffic, commercial fleet depots with multiple vehicles, busy workplace charging during peak hours, shopping center parking with high turnover, and residential societies with many EV owners.

60KW DC FAST CHARGING POWER
----------------------------
The Nova 60's power output characteristics:

60 Kilowatt DC Power:
Delivers up to 60 kilowatts of direct current power to compatible electric vehicles. This represents mid-range DC fast charging power - exactly double the entry-level Navigator 30 and half the power of the Nova 120. The 60kW level provides excellent balance between charging speed and infrastructure cost for passenger car applications.

Charging Speed Performance:
At 60kW full power, the Nova 60 typically adds approximately 300 to 350 kilometers of driving range per hour of charging for most modern electric vehicles. This is approximately twice as fast as the Navigator 30's charging speed. When split between two vehicles at 30kW each, each vehicle receives approximately 150-175 km of range per hour - still significantly faster than any AC charging.

Typical Charging Times (Single Vehicle, Full 60kW):
- Small battery EV (30-40 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 15-20 minutes
- Medium battery EV (50-60 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 25-30 minutes
- Large battery EV (70-80 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 35-40 minutes

Typical Charging Times (Dual Vehicles, 30kW Each):
When charging two vehicles simultaneously with power split, charging times are approximately double the single-vehicle times listed above. However, total station throughput (vehicles charged per hour) improves significantly.

Comparison to Other Power Levels:
- Navigator 30: Nova 60 charges exactly 2x faster (when using full power on one vehicle)
- Nova 120: Nova 120 charges exactly 2x faster than Nova 60
- AC Chargers: Nova 60 is approximately 8-10 times faster than 7.5kW AC charging

CCS2 CONNECTOR COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------------
The Nova 60 uses dual CCS2 charging standard:

Dual CCS2 Configuration:
Both charging guns use the CCS2 (Combined Charging System Type 2) standard, which is the DC fast charging standard for India and most global markets. CCS2 provides maximum compatibility with the Indian EV market where virtually all modern electric vehicles support CCS2 DC fast charging.

Vehicle Compatibility:
Compatible with all CCS2-compliant electric vehicles sold in India including all Tata electric vehicles (Nexon EV, Tigor EV, Punch EV, Curvv EV), all MG electric vehicles (ZS EV, Comet EV, Windsor EV), Mahindra XUV400 and BE series, all Hyundai electric vehicles (Ioniq 5, Kona Electric), all BYD models (Atto 3, e6, Seal), Citroen eC3, Volvo XC40 Recharge, and virtually all electric cars sold in India from 2020 onwards.

CHARGING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY
------------------------------------
Understanding Nova 60 real-world performance:

Dynamic Power Distribution:
When charging two vehicles simultaneously, Nova 60 intelligently distributes the 60kW based on what each vehicle can accept. If one vehicle is at high state of charge (above 80%) and charging slowly, the Nova 60 can allocate more power to the second vehicle that's charging faster. This dynamic allocation maximizes total throughput.

State of Charge Curves:
DC fast charging delivers maximum speed from 20% to 50% state of charge. Speed gradually reduces from 50% to 80% as battery approaches capacity. Charging slows significantly above 80% to protect battery longevity. Commercial operators typically charge to 80% then move to next vehicle.

Temperature Management:
Cold batteries charge more slowly for safety - Nova 60 adjusts power accordingly. Hot batteries may also require reduced charging power. Intelligent thermal management optimizes charging speed while protecting battery health.

Session Optimization for Throughput:
For maximum station productivity, operators should encourage users to charge to 80% then leave rather than waiting for 100%. The time from 80% to 100% is disproportionately long and reduces station throughput. Implementing idle fees above 80% state of charge encourages efficient station use.
