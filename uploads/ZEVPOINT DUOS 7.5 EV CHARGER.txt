PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
The Zevpoint Duos is a groundbreaking wall-mounted electric vehicle charger that represents India's first OCPP-enabled EV charger with a seamless Home-Commercial Toggle Switch. This innovative dual-mode functionality allows the Duos to serve as both a private home charger and a commercial networked charging station, all in one device.

Whether you're charging your electric vehicle at home for personal use or operating in a commercial setting as part of a networked charging infrastructure, the Duos adapts instantly with just one physical toggle switch. This gives you unprecedented flexibility to use a single charger for both personal and business needs without requiring separate hardware purchases or complex software reconfiguration.

The Duos is engineered for performance, safety, and convenience. It is more than just a charger - it is a smart charging solution that bridges the gap between residential and commercial charging applications. The ability to toggle between home mode and commercial OCPP mode makes the Duos unique in the Indian EV charging market.

The Duos is designed for users who want professional-grade features, networked charging capabilities, and the flexibility to use their charger in different contexts. It's perfect for home-based businesses, small charging networks, property owners who want to monetize their charger, or anyone who needs both private and commercial charging functionality.

REVOLUTIONARY HOME-COMMERCIAL TOGGLE SWITCH
--------------------------------------------
The Duos's most distinctive feature is its physical toggle switch that instantly changes operating modes:

Home Mode:
When the toggle switch is set to Home Mode, the Duos operates as a standard smart home charger similar to other Zevpoint wall chargers. In this mode, the charger functions independently without requiring network connectivity or central management system. Features available in Home Mode include Plug and Charge automatic operation, Zevpoint Home mobile app control via Bluetooth, RFID card access control for family members, local scheduling and current adjustment, and energy monitoring through the app. Home Mode is ideal for personal vehicle charging at your residence with full privacy and independent operation.

Commercial Mode (OCPP):
When the toggle switch is set to Commercial Mode, the Duos becomes an OCPP-compliant networked charging station that connects to a central Charge Point Management System (CPMS). OCPP stands for Open Charge Point Protocol, which is the industry-standard communication protocol that allows charging stations to communicate with central management software platforms. In Commercial Mode, the Duos can be managed remotely through CPMS platforms, support payment processing for public charging, provide detailed usage analytics and reporting, integrate with billing systems for monetization, allow remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, enable dynamic load management across multiple chargers, and support fleet management requirements.

Toggle Switch Operation:
The physical toggle switch is located on the Duos wallbox unit for easy access. Switching between modes requires only flipping the toggle switch - no software reconfiguration or app settings needed. The charger automatically recognizes the mode change and adjusts its operation accordingly. The mode switch can be changed at any time based on current needs.

Why Toggle Switch Innovation Matters:
Traditional chargers are designed for either home use OR commercial use, requiring users to purchase separate hardware for different scenarios. The Duos eliminates this limitation by providing both capabilities in one device. This is particularly valuable for: home-based business owners who want to offer charging to customers while also charging personal vehicles, property owners who want flexibility to switch between private use and revenue-generating public access, small businesses that need charging for company vehicles during day and employee vehicles after hours, and users planning future commercial applications but starting with home use.

The toggle switch provides instant mode switching without requiring firmware updates, software reconfiguration, or technical expertise. This user-friendly approach makes commercial charging accessible to non-technical users.

OCPP PROTOCOL SUPPORT AND CAPABILITIES
---------------------------------------
The Duos supports OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol), making it compatible with commercial charging networks:

What is OCPP:
OCPP stands for Open Charge Point Protocol. It is an open-source application protocol that allows charging stations to communicate with a central management system regardless of manufacturer. Think of OCPP as a universal language that allows chargers from different manufacturers to work with charging management software from different vendors. OCPP was developed through industry collaboration to prevent vendor lock-in and enable interoperability.

Why OCPP Matters:
Without OCPP, charging stations can only work with proprietary management systems from the same manufacturer, limiting flexibility and choice. OCPP enables users to choose the best hardware and software independently, integrate chargers from multiple manufacturers into one network, switch management platforms without replacing hardware, and access advanced features like remote monitoring, billing, and load management. OCPP is becoming the industry standard, with most new commercial chargers supporting this protocol.

OCPP Features Enabled on Duos:
When operating in Commercial Mode with OCPP enabled, the Duos supports: remote start and stop of charging sessions via CPMS, real-time status monitoring and reporting, transaction records with detailed session data, remote configuration and firmware updates, smart charging and load management, reservation systems for scheduled charging, payment integration for monetization, user authentication via RFID or app, energy metering and consumption tracking, fault reporting and remote diagnostics, and fleet management functionality.

CPMS Integration:
The Duos connects to Charge Point Management System (CPMS) platforms via internet connection when in Commercial Mode. Popular CPMS platforms that work with OCPP-compliant chargers include open-source solutions like OpenChargeMap, commercial platforms like Clenergy EV, fleet management systems, and property management integrations. Users can choose any OCPP-compatible CPMS based on their specific needs and budget.

Commercial Use Cases:
OCPP support enables the Duos to be used for: retail charging where customers pay per kWh or per session, workplace charging with employee access control and billing, fleet charging with vehicle assignment tracking, property charging in apartments or condos with tenant billing, hospitality charging at hotels or restaurants, parking facility charging with payment integration, and small charging networks with centralized management.

OCPP Version:
The Duos typically supports OCPP 1.6 or OCPP 2.0 (verify specific version with Zevpoint). OCPP 1.6 is widely supported by most CPMS platforms. OCPP 2.0 includes advanced features like ISO 15118 Plug and Charge capability.
