SAFETY AND PROTECTION FEATURES
-------------------------------
The Spyder AIO incorporates comprehensive advanced safety protection systems:

Built-in RCD (Residual Current Device):
The Spyder AIO includes an integrated RCD, also known as RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker). This advanced safety feature continuously monitors for current leakage and disconnects power if dangerous leakage is detected. The built-in RCD protects against electric shock hazards and is a premium safety feature not found in most portable chargers.

Over-Voltage Protection:
Guards against input voltage spikes and surges from electrical grid that could damage charger or vehicle. Protects on all phases in three-phase mode.

Under-Voltage Protection:
Prevents operation when input voltage drops below safe levels, protecting against brownout conditions and ensuring consistent charging performance.

Overload Protection:
Prevents damage from excessive current draw beyond rated capacity. Monitors load on each phase separately in three-phase mode.

Short Circuit Protection:
Instantaneous automatic disconnection in short circuit fault conditions prevents fire hazards and equipment damage.

Leakage Protection:
Advanced residual current detection integrated with built-in RCD prevents electric shock hazards by monitoring minute current leakage to ground.

Over-Temperature Protection:
Multi-zone thermal monitoring system prevents damage from excessive heat buildup during high-power charging. Automatically reduces current or stops charging if temperature exceeds safe limits.

Water Resistance:
IP66 rating provides protection against powerful water jets from any direction. Suitable for outdoor use in heavy rain and wet conditions.

Dust Resistance:
IP66 complete dust sealing prevents particle ingress even in very dusty environments like construction sites or rural areas.

Ground Protection:
Continuous earth monitoring ensures proper grounding connection is maintained throughout charging session.

Automatic Connector Detection:
The Spyder AIO automatically detects which power plug is connected and adjusts operation accordingly. This prevents accidental use of wrong current settings for attached plug, eliminating risk of burnout or electrical hazards.

The comprehensive safety features combined with built-in RCD make the Spyder AIO one of the safest EV chargers available, suitable for demanding commercial use and outdoor installation in challenging conditions.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
Installation requirements vary based on which plug type and phase configuration you plan to use:

For 16A Standard Plug Operation:
Power Socket: Standard 16 ampere 3-pin socket (most common household socket in India)
Wiring: Minimum 2.5 square millimeter cable (existing household wiring usually adequate)
MCB: 20 ampere single-pole MCB
Power Output: Up to 3.6 kW
Earthing: Proper earthing mandatory
SPD: Surge Protection Device recommended
This configuration works with existing household electrical infrastructure in most homes.

For 32A Single-Phase Plug Operation:
Power Socket: Dedicated 32 ampere single-phase industrial socket (CEE socket included in package)
Wiring: Minimum 6 square millimeter 3-core copper cable. In hot environments consider 10 square millimeter.
MCB: 40 ampere double-pole MCB
Power Output: Up to 7.5 kW
Earthing: Proper earthing mandatory with resistance below 5 ohms
SPD: Surge Protection Device mandatory
RCB: Residual Current Breaker recommended (in addition to built-in RCD)
This configuration requires dedicated circuit installation by qualified electrician.

For 32A Three-Phase Plug Operation:
Power Socket: Dedicated 32 ampere three-phase 5-pin industrial socket (included in package)
Wiring: Minimum 6 square millimeter 5-core copper cable (3 phases + neutral + earth). In hot environments consider 10 square millimeter.
MCB: 40 ampere four-pole MCB (disconnects all three phases plus neutral)
Power Output: Up to 16 kW
Voltage: 400V three-phase supply required
Earthing: Robust earthing mandatory with resistance below 5 ohms
SPD: Three-phase Surge Protection Device mandatory
RCB: Three-phase Residual Current Breaker recommended
This configuration requires three-phase electrical supply and professional installation by electrician experienced with three-phase systems.

General Installation Considerations:
The Spyder AIO's versatility allows starting with basic 16A installation and upgrading to higher power as electrical infrastructure improves. For example: install 16A initially for 3.6 kW charging, upgrade to 32A single-phase for 7.5 kW when budget allows, further upgrade to three-phase for 16 kW if three-phase supply becomes available.

Voltage Stabilizer:
If location experiences frequent power fluctuations, use appropriate voltage stabilizer. For single-phase 7.5 kW use 8-10 kVA stabilizer. For three-phase 16 kW use 15-20 kVA three-phase stabilizer.

Wall Mounting Installation:
Use included mounting bracket. Choose location within 6 meters of parking spot. Ensure location has adequate ventilation. Protect from direct harsh weather if possible (though IP66 allows outdoor installation). Mount at convenient height for touchscreen access (approximately 1.2-1.5 meters from ground).

CHARGING PERFORMANCE AND SPEED
-------------------------------
The Spyder AIO delivers variable charging performance based on configuration:

Maximum Performance - Three-Phase 16kW Mode:
At full 16 kilowatt output on three-phase power, the Spyder AIO can add approximately 65 to 80 kilometers of driving range per hour of charging for most modern electric vehicles. This represents the fastest portable charging available.

Single-Phase 7.5kW Performance:
At 7.5 kilowatt on single-phase 32A, adds approximately 40 to 50 kilometers range per hour. Full charge times approximately 5 to 6 hours for 40 kWh battery, 6 to 7 hours for 50 kWh battery.

16A Plug 3.6kW Performance:
At 3.6 kilowatt on 16A plug, adds approximately 25 to 30 kilometers range per hour. Full charge times approximately 10 to 12 hours for 40 kWh battery, suitable for overnight charging.

Performance Comparison:
The Spyder AIO at 16 kW on three-phase charges more than twice as fast as 7.5 kW single-phase portable chargers and over four times faster than standard 3.6 kW portable chargers. This makes it competitive with many wall-mounted chargers while maintaining portability.



VERSATILITY AND USE CASES
--------------------------
The Spyder AIO's comprehensive features make it suitable for the widest range of use cases:

Home Charging Multiple Scenarios:
Start with 16A plug for overnight charging, upgrade to 32A single-phase for faster evening charging, switch to three-phase if property gets upgraded to three-phase supply. One charger grows with your electrical infrastructure.
