SECTION 4: TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

4.1 AC CHARGING FUNDAMENTALS
- AC charging uses alternating current from home/commercial power supplies
- Vehicle's onboard charger converts AC to DC for battery charging
- Maximum charging speed limited by vehicle's onboard charger capacity
- Higher-rated chargers auto-adjust to vehicle's maximum supported speed

4.2 CHARGER COMPATIBILITY PRINCIPLES
- All EV chargers are backward compatible
- A 22 kW charger will work with a 3.3 kW vehicle (charges at 3.3 kW)
- An 11 kW charger will work with a 7 kW vehicle (charges at 7 kW)
- 7 kW, 7.2kW, 7.4 kW, 7.5 kW are used interachangeably to describe the same charger. These are 32 A chargers and the output power depends on the voltage
- Always safe to install higher-capacity charger for future-proofing

4.3 INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS
- Portable chargers: Plug-and-play, no installation required
- Wall-mount chargers: Require professional electrical installation
- Higher power chargers (11 kW, 22 kW) may require electrical panel upgrades
- Always consult certified electrician for installation

4.4 CHARGING TIME CALCULATION
- Charging Time (hours) = Battery Capacity (kWh) ÷ Charging Power (kW)
- Example: 50 kWh battery ÷ 7 kW charger = ~7 hours (0-100%)
- Actual times may vary based on battery state, temperature, and vehicle settings
