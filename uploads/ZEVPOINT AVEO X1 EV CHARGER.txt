INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
To safely install and operate the Aveo X1 at its full 11 kilowatt capacity, the following requirements must be met:

Power Supply Requirements - Three Phase Operation:
A dedicated three-phase electrical supply with 400-440V line-to-line voltage is required for full 11 kW operation. Three-phase power consists of three live wires (R, Y, B or L1, L2, L3), one neutral wire, and one earth wire. The supply must be balanced with equal voltage across all three phases. Three-phase supply is typically available in commercial buildings, industrial facilities, agricultural installations, and some high-power residential properties. Most standard Indian homes have only single-phase supply and would require electrical service upgrade to add three-phase for full 11 kW operation.

Power Socket Requirements:
A dedicated 16 ampere 5-pin industrial socket is required for three-phase connection. The Aveo X1 package includes this specialized socket. The socket must be installed by a qualified electrician with experience in three-phase installations. Socket pin configuration is: 3 phase wires, 1 neutral wire, 1 earth wire. The socket circuit should be dedicated exclusively to the EV charger with no other loads sharing the circuit. Socket installation must follow local electrical codes and three-phase wiring standards.

Electrical Wiring Requirements - Three Phase:
Use a minimum of 4 square millimeter, 5-core copper cable for three-phase installations. The five cores are: Three phase wires (R, Y, B), one neutral wire, and one earth wire. Cable insulation should be rated for at least 90 degrees Celsius operating temperature with UV resistance for outdoor runs. In hot climate regions, enclosed spaces with limited ventilation, or long cable runs, upgrade to 6 square millimeter copper cable to handle heat dissipation better and reduce voltage drop. Cable run length should be minimized to reduce voltage drop across three phases. For cable runs exceeding 30 meters, consult a qualified electrician for appropriate cable sizing calculations.

Earthing System Requirements:
Proper earthing (grounding) is absolutely mandatory for safe operation of the Aveo X1 at high power levels. The power socket must be connected to a reliable earth ground. The earthing system must comply with local electrical safety codes and national electrical regulations for three-phase installations. Earth electrode should be inspected and tested annually to ensure adequate grounding is maintained. Three-phase systems require robust earthing due to higher power levels.

Circuit Protection Requirements - Three Phase:
Install a 20 ampere four-pole MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) on the dedicated three-phase charger circuit. The four-pole MCB provides simultaneous disconnection of all three phase wires and neutral during faults. Additionally install a three-phase Surge Protection Device (SPD) to protect against voltage spikes on all phases from electrical grid and lightning-induced surges. The SPD should be rated for Type 2 protection with appropriate voltage clamping levels for 400V three-phase systems. Consider installing a three-phase RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) for additional leakage protection.

Voltage Stabilizer Considerations:
If your location experiences frequent three-phase power fluctuations, phase imbalance, or voltage instability, use an appropriate three-phase voltage stabilizer. The stabilizer should be rated for at least 12 kVA capacity (preferably 15 kVA) to handle the Aveo X1's power requirements with adequate safety margin. Three-phase stabilizers are more critical than single-phase as they also balance voltage across phases. This is particularly important in areas with unreliable three-phase supply or where one phase is heavily loaded.


Network Requirements for Smart Features:
WiFi network connectivity is required at installation location for full smart features. The charger should be positioned within reliable WiFi signal range of wireless router. The Aveo X1 supports 2.4 GHz WiFi networks (verify router compatibility). Ensure WiFi network has stable internet connectivity for remote access and cloud-based app features. Bluetooth connection works without WiFi for local control.

Installation Location Considerations:
The Aveo X1 can be permanently wall-mounted using included bracket or kept portable for travel use. For wall mounting, choose a location that provides: proximity within 5-6 meters to vehicle charging port when parked, protection from direct harsh weather if possible (though IP66 rating allows outdoor installation), adequate ventilation around charger unit especially important for high-power operation, convenient access for cable management, within WiFi signal range, and protection from potential physical damage. For three-phase installations, location must be near three-phase supply point.

CHARGING PERFORMANCE AND SPEED
-------------------------------
The Aveo X1 delivers the fastest portable charging performance in Zevpoint's lineup:

Charging Speed - Three Phase Full Power:
At full 11 kilowatt output on three-phase power, the Aveo X1 can add approximately 65 to 70 kilometers of driving range per hour of charging for most modern electric vehicles. This is significantly faster than standard 7.5 kW chargers. Actual range added depends on vehicle efficiency, battery condition, ambient temperature, and driving patterns.

Charging Speed - Single Phase Reduced Power:
When operating on single-phase at 3.6 kW, the Aveo X1 adds approximately 25 to 30 kilometers of range per hour, matching the Aveo Pro performance.

THREE-PHASE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM EXPLANATION
------------------------------------------
Since the Aveo X1's key feature is three-phase capability, understanding three-phase power is important:

What is Three-Phase Power:
Three-phase electrical power consists of three alternating current wires that are offset by 120 degrees in their electrical cycles. Combined with neutral and earth, this creates a 5-wire system. Three-phase provides more stable power delivery and higher total power capacity than single-phase using smaller wire sizes.

Where Three-Phase is Available:
- Commercial buildings and office complexes
- Industrial facilities and manufacturing plants
- Some high-power residential properties
- Properties in industrial zones
- Buildings with elevators or large HVAC systems
- Hospitality facilities like hotels and resorts

How to Identify Three-Phase Supply:
Check your electrical panel - three-phase has three separate circuit breakers for main supply instead of one or two. Look at your electricity meter - three-phase meters show three voltage readings. Consult your electricity bill which should indicate single-phase or three-phase connection. Contact your electricity distribution company to confirm.

Voltage Specifications:
In India, three-phase supply provides 400-440V line-to-line (between any two phases) and 230V line-to-neutral (from any phase to neutral). This higher voltage combined with three phases allows 11 kW power with only 16A per phase.

Advantages for EV Charging:
Three-phase allows higher power with lower current per wire, reducing cable size and heat generation. Provides smoother power delivery to the charger. Enables 11 kW portable charging which is otherwise impossible on single-phase within 32A limits.

Converting to Three-Phase:
Homeowners can request three-phase connection from their electricity distribution company. Costs vary by location but typically involve application fee, wiring upgrades, and higher fixed charges on electricity bills. Approval depends on factors like property type, location, and intended use.
