THREE-PHASE POWER CAPABILITY
-----------------------------
The Polar X1's key differentiator is its three-phase electrical power support:

Three-Phase Operation:
The Polar X1 delivers its full 11 kilowatt charging power when connected to three-phase electrical supply. Three-phase power consists of three alternating current wires (R, Y, B or L1, L2, L3) plus neutral and earth, providing 400 volts line-to-line voltage. Three-phase supply enables significantly higher power delivery compared to single-phase systems while using lower current per phase.

Where Three-Phase is Available:
Three-phase electrical supply is commonly found in commercial buildings and offices, industrial facilities and manufacturing plants, larger residential properties and villas, properties in industrial-zoned areas, buildings with elevators or central HVAC, agricultural properties and farms, and hospitality facilities like hotels and resorts. Many newer apartment complexes and gated communities also have three-phase infrastructure.

Three-Phase Advantages for 11kW Charging:
At 11 kilowatts on three-phase 400V supply, the Polar X1 draws only 16 amperes per phase. This is the same per-phase current as a 3.6kW single-phase charger. The balanced load across three phases reduces heat generation and stress on electrical wiring. Three-phase operation is more efficient and enables higher total power without requiring thick cables or high-current single-phase circuits.

Single-Phase Compatibility:
While designed primarily for three-phase operation to deliver full 11kW power, the Polar X1 may also be compatible with single-phase supply at reduced power output (typically 7.5kW maximum). Verify with Zevpoint for specific single-phase operating capabilities if three-phase power is not available.

Identifying Three-Phase Supply:
Check your electrical distribution panel - three-phase has three separate main circuit breakers instead of one or two. Your electricity meter will show three voltage readings for three-phase supply. Your electricity bill should indicate if connection is single-phase or three-phase. Contact your electricity distribution company to confirm supply type and voltage.

THREE-IN-ONE CHARGING MODES
----------------------------
The Polar X1 offers versatile 3-in-1 charging mode functionality:
