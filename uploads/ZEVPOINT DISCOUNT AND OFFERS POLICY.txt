FREE ACCESSORY OPTIONS (Alternative to Discount)
------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: Offer EITHER discount OR accessory - NOT BOTH together.
Present both options and let customer choose one:

Charger Holder Stand:
- Worth: Rs.999
- Suitable for: All portable chargers
- Benefit: Keeps charger organized, prevents cable damage

Jumper Cable (for 7kW+ portable chargers):
- Worth: Rs.1,899
- Suitable for: Aveo Pro, Aveo X1, Dash, Spyder AIO
- Benefit: Emergency use, extends cable reach

Offer these as: "Instead of a discount, I can include a free charger holder worth Rs.999" or "We can add a jumper cable worth Rs.1,899 at no extra cost"

NO-COST EMI PURCHASES
---------------------
When customer is using No-Cost EMI (3-month EMI option):
- RESIST additional discounting
- EMI itself is a benefit (no interest charges)
- Politely explain: "Since you're already getting the benefit of no-cost EMI, we're unable to offer additional discounts on this order"
- Can still offer free accessories if customer insists

WHEN CUSTOMER ASKS FOR MORE DISCOUNT
------------------------------------
If customer is not satisfied with the offered discount and asks for more:
1. Reiterate product advantages and value
2. Mention warranty (5 years cable, 2 years electronics)
3. Highlight included accessories (carry bag, wall bracket, socket for 7kW models)
4. If still insisting, connect to a specialist: "Let me connect you with our sales specialist who can discuss this further"

  - Number of units

SAMPLE RESPONSES
----------------

Customer: "Any discount available?"
Response: "Yes, we can offer a small discount. For the [product name], I can offer Rs.[amount] off. Alternatively, I can include a free charger holder worth Rs.999. Which would you prefer?"

Customer: "Can you give more discount?"
Response: "I understand. The [product] already includes a carry bag, wall bracket, and comes with 5-year warranty on the cable. It's excellent value. However, if you'd like to discuss further, I can connect you with our sales specialist."

Customer: "I want discount on EMI purchase"
Response: "Since you're already benefiting from our no-cost EMI option with zero interest charges, additional discounts aren't available on EMI orders. However, I can include a free charger holder with your order."

If you've decided to proceed, we're definitely open to offering competitive pricing. I can connect you with our commercial sales team to discuss specific numbers."

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- Never promise exact discount amounts upfront for DC chargers
- Always position discounts as "special" or "for you"
- Free accessories are often more valuable than small discounts
- Maintain product value perception - don't discount too eagerly
- If unsure, connect to specialist rather than overpromising
