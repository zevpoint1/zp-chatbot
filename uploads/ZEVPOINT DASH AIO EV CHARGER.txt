UNIQUE DUAL-CONNECTOR SYSTEM
-----------------------------
The Dash AIO's revolutionary dual-connector system provides exceptional versatility:

Two Connector Types Included:
The Dash AIO comes with two different power connectors that can be swapped based on your charging location and available power socket type:

16 Ampere Type M 3-Pin Standard Plug:
This is the standard Indian household plug configuration (Type M, also known as South African plug type). It works with regular 16 ampere household electrical sockets found in virtually every home, office, and building in India. This plug delivers up to 3.6 kilowatt charging power with adjustable current from 8A to 16A. This connector is ideal for overnight charging at home, charging at friend's or relative's homes, hotel rooms during travel, or any location with standard household electrical outlets.

32 Ampere CEE Industrial Plug:
This is a professional-grade industrial plug configuration designed for high-power applications. It works with dedicated 32 ampere industrial sockets and delivers the full 7.5 kilowatt fast charging power with adjustable current from 8A to 32A. This connector is ideal for dedicated home charging installations with proper wiring, workplace charging locations with industrial power, service centers or commercial facilities, and any location with robust electrical infrastructure.

How the Dual-Connector System Works:
The Dash AIO has a modular plug interface where either connector can be attached to the main charger body. Users simply swap connectors based on the available power socket at their charging location. When the 16A plug is connected, the charger automatically limits maximum current to 16A to protect the household socket. When the 32A plug is connected, the charger allows up to 32A current for full 7.5 kW fast charging.

Connector Swapping:
Swapping between connectors is quick and simple. Disconnect charger from power socket, press release mechanism on current connector, remove connector from charger body, align and insert desired connector, push firmly until it clicks into place, verify secure connection, and connect to appropriate power socket. The entire swap process takes less than 30 seconds and requires no tools.

Why Dual-Connector is Revolutionary:
Traditional portable chargers include only one plug type, meaning users must purchase separate chargers or expensive adapter accessories to work with different socket types. The Dash AIO eliminates this problem by including both plug types in one package. This is particularly valuable in India where homes may have standard 16A sockets while workplaces may have industrial 32A sockets. With Dash AIO, one charger handles all scenarios.
