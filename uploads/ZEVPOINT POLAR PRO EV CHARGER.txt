THREE-IN-ONE CHARGING MODES
----------------------------
The Polar Pro offers versatile 3-in-1 charging mode functionality, providing multiple ways to control and initiate charging:

Mode 1 - Plug and Charge (Automatic):
The simplest charging mode where the charger automatically starts charging as soon as you plug the connector into your vehicle. No buttons to press, no apps to open, no RFID cards to scan. Just plug in and charging begins immediately. This mode is ideal for private home use where only the vehicle owner uses the charger. Provides fastest and most convenient charging experience with zero user interaction required beyond plugging in.

Mode 2 - RFID Card Authorization:
The Polar Pro includes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) card reader functionality for access-controlled charging. Users must tap an authorized RFID card on the charger to initiate charging session. This mode is ideal for shared charging locations, workplace charging installations where you want to track who is using the charger, residential buildings with shared parking, or any scenario where you want to restrict charging access to authorized users only. The Polar Pro can store multiple authorized RFID cards in its memory. RFID cards can be programmed, added, or removed through the Zevpoint Home app.

Mode 3 - Zevpoint Home Mobile App Control:
The Polar Pro features advanced Bluetooth connectivity for comprehensive app-based control through the Zevpoint Home mobile application. Users can start and stop charging sessions remotely from their smartphone, monitor charging progress in real-time, set charging schedules for off-peak electricity rates, view charging history and energy consumption, adjust charging current settings, and manage RFID card authorizations all through the intuitive app interface. The app works via Bluetooth connection, so you need to be within Bluetooth range (typically 10-30 meters) of the charger.

Mode Selection:
Users can select which of the three charging modes to use based on their preferences and use case. The mode can be configured through the Zevpoint Home app. Different modes can be used for different charging sessions - for example, use Plug and Charge mode for your own vehicle at home, but enable RFID mode when guests visit and you want to track their charging usage.

The 3-in-1 charging versatility makes the Polar Pro suitable for diverse installation scenarios from simple private home use to more complex shared or workplace installations.

EMERGENCY STOP SWITCH
----------------------
The Polar Pro features a unique physical emergency stop switch, a safety feature not commonly found on entry-level wall chargers:

Emergency Switch Location:
The emergency stop button is prominently located on the front face of the Polar Pro wallbox for easy access in emergency situations.

When to Use Emergency Stop:
The emergency stop switch should be used in genuine emergency situations including: electrical fault or sparking, unusual smell or smoke from charger, vehicle charging port malfunction, immediate need to disconnect power, safety hazard around charging area, vehicle needs to be moved urgently, or any other emergency requiring instant charging disconnection.

How Emergency Stop Works:
Pressing the emergency stop button immediately terminates the charging session and cuts power to the vehicle. This is a hardware-level disconnect that works independently of any software or app controls. The physical switch provides fail-safe emergency shutdown even if charger software or app experiences issues. Emergency stop is faster than unplugging cable or using app to stop charging.

After Using Emergency Stop:
Once emergency situation is resolved, the emergency stop button must be reset (twisted or pulled depending on design) before charging can resume. This prevents accidental restart of charging after emergency stop activation. Charger will not resume charging until emergency stop is properly reset and charging is manually restarted.

Why Emergency Stop Matters:
The emergency stop switch provides important safety benefits for home charging installations. It gives users physical control to immediately stop charging in any situation. This is particularly valuable for installations where children might access the area, elderly users who prefer physical controls, locations where multiple people may need to stop charging quickly, or compliance with electrical safety codes requiring emergency disconnect.

Zevpoint recommends that all household members who might be near the charger be familiar with emergency stop location and operation.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
The Polar Pro requires professional permanent installation:

Mounting Location:
Wall mounting at appropriate height (typically 1.2 to 1.5 meters from ground). Location should be within 5 meters of vehicle parking spot when parked. Choose location protected from direct weather if possible (though outdoor installation is supported). Ensure adequate ventilation around wallbox. Surface must be solid wall capable of supporting 6.5 kg weight plus cable weight.

Power Supply Requirements:
Dedicated single-phase electrical supply with 220-240V voltage. Circuit must have adequate connected load capacity to support continuous 32A draw. Dedicated circuit recommended - avoid sharing with other high-power appliances. Circuit should be independently protected with proper circuit breaker.

Electrical Wiring Requirements:
Use minimum 6 square millimeter 3-core copper cable (line, neutral, earth) for permanent installation from distribution board to wallbox location. In hot climate regions or enclosed spaces, upgrade to 10 square millimeter copper cable for better heat dissipation. Cable insulation should be rated for at least 90 degrees Celsius operating temperature. For outdoor cable runs, use UV-resistant cable insulation or protect cable in conduit. Cable run length should be minimized to reduce voltage drop.

Earthing System Requirements:
Proper earthing (grounding) is absolutely mandatory for wall-mounted charger safety. Wallbox must be connected to reliable earth ground with resistance below 5 ohms. Earthing system must comply with local electrical safety codes. Earth electrode should be tested to ensure adequate grounding.

Circuit Protection Requirements:
Install 40 ampere double-pole or two-pole MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) on dedicated charger circuit. The double-pole MCB provides complete isolation of both line and neutral during faults. Install Surge Protection Device (SPD) to protect against voltage spikes and lightning-induced surges. Install RCD (Residual Current Device) or RCCB rated at 30mA for leakage protection. The combination of MCB, SPD, and RCD provides comprehensive protection.

Voltage Stabilizer Considerations:
If location experiences frequent power fluctuations, voltage instability, or brownouts, install appropriate voltage stabilizer. Stabilizer should be rated for at least 8-10 kVA capacity to handle Polar Pro power requirements. This is particularly important in areas with unreliable grid power.

Professional Installation Required:
Wall-mounted chargers should only be installed by qualified licensed electricians. Installation involves permanent electrical work including circuit breaker installation, wiring runs, and wallbox mounting. DIY installation not recommended and may void warranty. Zevpoint offers doorstep installation service in select cities.
