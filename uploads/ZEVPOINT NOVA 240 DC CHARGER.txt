The complete commercial charging solution is ready for immediate revenue generation from day one of installation.

Designed with a rugged stainless steel body for industrial-strength durability, intelligent advanced cooling systems for sustained high-power operation in any climate, and a large 15-inch LCD display with LED indicators for exceptional user experience, the Nova 240 delivers industrial strength, user-friendly control, and round-the-clock reliability even under the most demanding continuous operation.

Backed by a comprehensive 2-year on-site warranty and 48-hour priority service commitment, the Nova 240 is the ultimate fast-charging solution for high-demand commercial environments where maximum power, maximum reliability, and maximum throughput are non-negotiable requirements.

MAXIMUM 240KW ULTRA-FAST POWER
-------------------------------
The Nova 240's defining characteristic is maximum DC charging power:

240 Kilowatt DC Power:
Delivers up to 240 kilowatts of direct current power to compatible electric vehicles. This represents the maximum practical power for commercial AC-to-DC fast charging infrastructure. The 240kW level is exactly double the Nova 120, four times the Nova 60, and eight times the Navigator 30. This is the absolute highest power in Zevpoint's DC charger lineup.

Ultra-Fast Highway Corridor Charging:
For highway travel corridors, the Nova 240 enables true ultra-fast charging comparable to premium charging networks globally. Premium electric vehicles with high charging acceptance rates can charge sufficiently for long-distance travel in approximately 10-15 minutes. This matches or exceeds the charging speed of Tesla Supercharger installations, making the Nova 240 competitive with any charging infrastructure globally.

Heavy Vehicle Maximum Speed:
For electric buses and trucks with very large batteries (300-500 kWh), the Nova 240 provides the fastest practical charging speed. Buses can potentially charge from 20% to 80% in as little as 45-60 minutes when accepting high power. This dramatically reduces depot downtime and enables more aggressive electric bus deployment schedules.

Charging Speed Performance - Premium Passenger Cars:
At 240kW full power to a single premium passenger car that can accept maximum charging rates, the Nova 240 typically adds approximately 1000 to 1200 kilometers of driving range per hour of charging. This represents the fastest possible charging speed for passenger vehicles. Most premium vehicles accepting 200kW+ can gain 300-400 km of range in just 10-15 minutes.

Charging Speed Performance - Buses and Trucks:
For electric buses with 300-400 kWh batteries, the Nova 240 typically adds approximately 200 to 250 kilometers of range per hour when vehicles can accept high power. For electric trucks with 200-300 kWh batteries, adds approximately 300 to 400 kilometers of range per hour. The 240kW available power ensures heavy vehicles always charge at their maximum possible acceptance rate.

Typical Charging Times - Premium Passenger Cars (Single Vehicle, 200-240kW):
- Medium battery EV (50-60 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 6-10 minutes
- Large battery EV (70-80 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 10-15 minutes
- Premium large battery EV (100 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 12-18 minutes
- Ultra-premium EV (120-150 kWh): 20% to 80% in approximately 15-25 minutes

Typical Charging Times - Buses and Trucks (Maximum Power):
- Electric bus (300 kWh): 20% to 80% (180 kWh) in approximately 45-60 minutes
- Electric bus (400 kWh): 20% to 80% (240 kWh) in approximately 60-75 minutes
- Electric truck (200 kWh): 20% to 80% (120 kWh) in approximately 30-40 minutes
- Heavy-duty truck (300 kWh): 20% to 80% (180 kWh) in approximately 45-55 minutes

Real-World Acceptance Limitations:
Most passenger cars cannot accept full 240kW power - typical maximum acceptance is 100-150kW for most vehicles, with only premium latest-generation EVs accepting 200kW+. The Nova 240's advantage is ensuring vehicles always charge at their absolute maximum capability. Even when vehicles cannot accept full 240kW, they charge faster than with lower-power chargers due to higher available power.

Dual-Gun Power Distribution:
When two vehicles charge simultaneously, the 240kW total power is dynamically distributed. Common scenarios include 120kW to each vehicle (equal split), 150kW to premium car and 90kW to standard car, 180kW to bus and 60kW to car, or full 240kW to single vehicle when one gun is in use.

DUAL-GUN DYNAMIC LOAD SHARING
------------------------------
The Nova 240 features advanced dual-gun architecture optimized for maximum throughput:

Dual CCS2 Ultra-High-Power Guns:
Two independent CCS2 charging guns with heavy-duty liquid-cooled cables rated for sustained high-current operation. Each gun capable of delivering up to 240kW when used individually. Both guns can operate simultaneously with intelligent dynamic power distribution.

Dynamic Load Sharing at Scale:
The Nova 240's sophisticated power management system dynamically allocates the 240kW total power based on real-time vehicle acceptance rates, battery temperatures, state of charge, and charging curve characteristics. The system optimizes for maximum total energy delivery and minimum total charging time across both guns simultaneously.

Mixed Vehicle Type Optimization:
When charging different vehicle types simultaneously (for example, a premium passenger car and an electric bus), the Nova 240 intelligently allocates power to maximize total throughput. A bus charging slowly at 80% state of charge may receive 80kW while a car charges at 160kW. As conditions change, power reallocation happens seamlessly in real-time.

Maximum Throughput Advantage:
Dual-gun capability with 240kW total power enables the Nova 240 to potentially serve twice as many vehicles per day compared to single-gun alternatives. Critical for high-traffic highway corridors and commercial operations where maximizing vehicles served per day directly determines revenue and business viability.

HIGHWAY CORRIDOR AND ULTRA-FAST CHARGING FOCUS
-----------------------------------------------
The Nova 240 is specifically designed for applications requiring maximum speed:

Highway Charging Corridor Deployment:
The Nova 240 is ideal for national highway charging corridors enabling long-distance electric vehicle travel. Travelers can charge in 10-20 minutes while having a quick meal or break - comparable to traditional fuel stops. Multiple Nova 240 units enable high-traffic highway locations to serve continuous vehicle flow without significant queues.

Competitive with Premium Networks:
The Nova 240's 240kW power level enables Zevpoint installations to compete directly with Tesla Supercharger networks and other premium international charging infrastructure. This is critical for establishing India as a viable destination for international electric vehicle travel and for supporting domestic long-distance EV adoption.

Time-Critical Commercial Operations:
For commercial operations where time is money - delivery fleets, taxi/ride-sharing, logistics operations - the Nova 240 minimizes charging downtime. A delivery truck that would spend 2 hours charging at 60kW can charge in approximately 1 hour at 120kW (dual-gun operation) or even less at higher power allocation.

Premium Customer Experience:
The ultra-fast charging speed provided by Nova 240 creates a premium charging experience that encourages EV adoption among consumers who are concerned about charging time. The ability to charge in 10-15 minutes approaches the convenience of traditional refueling.

CCS2 ULTRA-HIGH-POWER CONNECTOR
--------------------------------
The Nova 240 uses dual CCS2 high-power standard:

Heavy-Duty CCS2 Configuration:
Both charging guns use the CCS2 standard with heavy-duty liquid-cooled cables capable of sustained high-current delivery. Liquid cooling is essential at 240kW power levels to prevent cable overheating. Cable cooling systems are integrated and automatic - no user maintenance required.

Universal Vehicle Compatibility:
Compatible with all CCS2-compliant electric vehicles from passenger cars to heavy buses and trucks. This includes all modern Indian-market EVs (Tata, MG, Mahindra, Hyundai, BYD, etc.) plus international vehicles, premium brands (Tesla Model 3/Y with CCS2, Mercedes EQS, BMW iX, Audi e-tron GT, Porsche Taycan), and commercial vehicles (BYD, Tata, Ashok Leyland electric buses and trucks).

High-Voltage Architecture Support:
The Nova 240 supports both standard 400V vehicle architectures and next-generation 800V high-voltage architectures. The 800V support is critical for achieving maximum charging speeds with latest-generation premium vehicles. Voltage range typically 200-1000V DC to accommodate all vehicle types.

OCPP 1.6 PROFESSIONAL NETWORK MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------------------
The Nova 240 includes enterprise-grade OCPP networking:
