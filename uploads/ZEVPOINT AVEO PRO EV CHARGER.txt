INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
To safely install and operate the Aveo Pro at its full 7.5 kilowatt capacity, the following requirements must be met:

Power Socket Requirements:
A dedicated 32 ampere electrical socket is required for optimal performance. The Aveo Pro package includes a 32A CEE industrial socket. This socket must be installed by a qualified electrician and must have adequate connected load capacity to support continuous 32 ampere draw. The socket circuit should be dedicated exclusively to the EV charger with no other loads sharing the circuit.

Electrical Wiring Requirements:
Use a minimum of 6 square millimeter, 3-core copper cable for standard installations. The three cores are: Line (Live), Neutral, and Earth (Ground). In hot climate regions or for installations in enclosed spaces with limited ventilation, upgrade to 10 square millimeter copper cable to handle heat dissipation better and ensure long-term reliability. Cable run length should be minimized to reduce voltage drop. For cable runs exceeding 20 meters, consult a qualified electrician for appropriate cable sizing.

Earthing System Requirements:
Proper earthing (grounding) is absolutely mandatory for safe operation of the Aveo Pro. The power socket must be connected to a reliable earth ground with resistance below 5 ohms. The earthing system must comply with local electrical safety codes and national electrical regulations. Never operate the charger without proper earthing as this creates severe electrical safety hazards.

Circuit Protection Requirements:
Install a 40 ampere double-pole or two-pole MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) on the dedicated charger circuit. The double-pole MCB provides disconnection of both line and neutral for complete isolation during faults. Additionally install a Surge Protection Device (SPD) to protect against voltage spikes and lightning-induced surges from the electrical grid. The SPD should be rated for Type 2 protection with appropriate voltage clamping levels.

Voltage Stabilizer Considerations:
If your location experiences frequent input power fluctuations, brownouts, or voltage instability, use an appropriate voltage stabilizer. The stabilizer should be rated for at least 8 kVA capacity to handle the Aveo Pro's power requirements with adequate safety margin. This is particularly important in areas with unreliable grid power or frequent voltage variations.

Network Requirements for Smart Features:
For full smart charging functionality, WiFi network connectivity is required at the installation location. The charger should be positioned within reliable WiFi signal range of your wireless router. The Aveo Pro supports 2.4 GHz WiFi networks (check router compatibility). Ensure your WiFi network has stable internet connectivity for remote access and app control features.

Installation Location Considerations:
The Aveo Pro can be permanently wall-mounted using the included bracket or kept portable for travel use. For wall mounting, choose a location that is: within 5 meters of your vehicle's charging port when parked, protected from direct harsh weather if possible (though IP67 rating allows outdoor use), accessible for cable management, within WiFi signal range, and has adequate space for cable storage when not in use.

CHARGING PERFORMANCE AND SPEED
-------------------------------
The Aveo Pro delivers professional-grade charging performance:

Charging Speed: At full 7.5 kilowatt output, the Aveo Pro can add approximately 50-55 kilometers of range per hour of charging for most modern electric vehicles. Actual range added depends on vehicle efficiency, battery condition, and environmental factors.

Comparison to Standard Charging: The Aveo Pro charges more than twice as fast as standard 3.6 kW portable chargers, significantly reducing overall charging time and making it practical for daily use without overnight charging.


TRAVEL AND PORTABILITY FEATURES
--------------------------------
Despite its higher power output, the Aveo Pro maintains excellent portability:

Compact Design: At 3.5 kg weight and compact dimensions, the Aveo Pro is easy to carry and store in vehicle trunk
Premium Carry Bag: Included carry bag provides protection during transport and travel
Cable Management: 5 meter cable length provides flexibility while remaining manageable for portable use
Quick Setup: Simple plug-and-charge operation requires no tools for portable deployment

Wide Temperature Range: Operates reliably from minus 35°C to plus 60°C across diverse climate conditions
Universal Compatibility: Type 2 connector works with all Type 2 equipped electric vehicles sold in India and Europe

The Aveo Pro is ideal for users who frequently travel long distances and need faster charging capability at multiple destinations while maintaining the convenience of a portable charger.

USE CASES AND APPLICATIONS
---------------------------
The Aveo Pro is suitable for multiple charging scenarios:

Primary Home Charging: Wall-mounted installation for daily charging at faster speeds than standard portable chargers. Ideal for households with high daily driving distances.

Multi-Vehicle Households: Single portable charger can be shared between multiple electric vehicles in the household, reducing total equipment cost.

Limited Load Situations: Adjustable current control allows operation in locations with restricted electrical capacity by reducing power draw to match available supply.

Fleet Applications: Suitable for small fleet operators who need portable charging capability for multiple vehicles at different locations.

Rental Properties: Perfect for renters who cannot install permanent charging infrastructure and need portable solution that can move with them.

Unable to install wall chargers: For people who do not have dedicated space to install a wall charger setup, and prefer flexibility of removing the charger after use

DISPLAY SCREEN INFORMATION
---------------------------
The Aveo Pro features an integrated digital display screen that provides real-time charging information:

Display Parameters:
- Input voltage (volts)
- Charging current (amperes)
- Power output (kilowatts)
- Charging duration (hours and minutes)
